# Project: Website on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - Health and Well-being

This repository contains the files of one of the first websites developed by me as part of a project during the first year of the Systems Development course at ETEC, in the Web Programming discipline, under the supervision of Professor [Fred Barbosa](https://github.com/fbamuniz).

## Project Description

The project consists of a website aimed at raising awareness about the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://www.ipea.gov.br/ods/ods3.html), focusing on health and well-being. It was developed in HTML and CSS, being one of the first websites created by the contributors. The work was carried out in a group, with significant contributions from all members. Programming was mainly led by Victor, while design, texts, and ideas were developed by Miguel and Larissa using Figma.
